Problem:
A local pizza shop is offering a special deal on a "Surprise Pie," which comes with 3 different toppings,
but the pizza chef gets to choose the toppings.
The pizza shop offers 8 "usual" toppings, like sausage, bacon, pepperoni, peppers, onions, mushrooms, broccoli, and olives.
It also offers 5 "unusual" toppings, like anchovies, shrimp, reindeer, eggs, and potatoes.

What is the probability that the pizza has only "unusual" toppings?
60/1716 == (5/13)*(4/12)*(3/11) == (5*4) / (13*12*11)



What is the probability that the pizza has exactly 1 "usual" topping?
?
What is the probability that the pizza has exactly 2 "usual" toppings?
?
What is the probability that the pizza has exactly 3 "usual" toppings?
?
What is the probability that the pizza has at least one "usual" topping?
?

A steroid detection test is 97% effective at detecting steroid use, meaning that the probability of a user testing positive is 0.97. 
Unfortunately, it has a false positive rate of 5%, meaning the the probability of of a nonuser testing positive is 0.05.
A large university estimates that about 6% of its athletes use steroids. 
The universityÂ’s quarterback tests positive for steroids, yet he claims he does not use them. What are the chances that he is telling the truth?

Suppose that it rains in Spain an average of once every 13 days, and when it does, hurricanes have a 6% chance of happening in Hartford. 
When it does not rain in Spain, hurricanes have a 4% chance of happening in Hartford. What is the probability that it rains in Spain when hurricanes happen in Hartford? 
(Round your answer to four decimal places.)
