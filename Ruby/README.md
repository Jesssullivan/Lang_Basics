# Ruby Tetrahedron Test for Sketchup

(current approach nonfunctional as of 8/5/18)

The goal is to create Tetrahedron from the x,y,z coordinate system.    

# New approaches:

"tetrah.rb" now functional as a bare-bones plugin for Sketchup.

The previous ideal works from the x,y plane first, creating a equilateral triangle with the following points, with scale being the variable length of one edge:
- (0,0,0)
- (scale,0,0)
- (scale/2, scale * (Math.sqrt(3) / 2) , 0)
